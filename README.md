# MakerSquare Fullstack Coding Challenge 

## Goals: Create a Twitter feed that allows us to search any valid Twitter handle and display their 25 most recent tweets.

This challenge is designed to test your ability to create a fullstack application using the following:

* JavaScript
* A Frontend Framework 
* A Backend Framework 
* RESTful APIs
* CSS and UI 
* Deployment

Important Notes:
* **Deadline:** Project is due EOD today (Tuesday) at 10pm. No commits made after the deadline will be considered when grading. 
* * After deploying your app or by 10pm today fill out the [completion survey](http://goo.gl/forms/BuKQ0nIdy57iVLPH2). **You MUST fill out this survey by EOD, even if you were not able to fully complete the CA.**
* All work on CA must be pushed up to your forked MKS-LA-Assessment repo by deadline. 
* View the grading rubric [here](https://docs.google.com/a/makersquare.com/document/d/1vHPv0QCBJQLts_w7CSMB9FCh946qKadFjVyA1p0jdOs/edit?usp=sharing). 
* * You may ask fellows clarifying questions that are non-technical.


* Your application can use third-party libraries and/or modules, but may not use any boilerplate or starter applications. 
* You may reference documentation, resources written by other devs, or Stack Overflow questions when researching a solution to a specific technical question, but copying code that other students, developers, or you have previously written will be considered academic dishonesty. If you didn't write it, and you don't fully understand what each line of code is doing, you should not include it in your app. Please clarify any concerns with a fellow. 


## Requirements 

### Frontend (Angular, Backbone or React)

      3. Have a loading spinner display when data is being queried or loaded.
      4. Create a filter by hashtag feature that only displays tweets that match the hashtag (not any key word) searched for.
      
### Backend 
   1. Required Features
